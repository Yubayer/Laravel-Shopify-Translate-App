## How To Use
This app is basically built using app embeds block extension.  The app can be used in two ways. First, this code [<div id="google_translate_element"></div>] can be used anywhere in the store.  Secondly, by turning on the show translate widget option from the app customization option, it can be used in the left or right position at the bottom of the page. The value of the left right and bottom position can be changed from the customization of the app.
